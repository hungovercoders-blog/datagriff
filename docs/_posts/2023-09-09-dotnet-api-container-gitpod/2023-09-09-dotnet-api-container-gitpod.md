Recently I decided to learn docker and all things containers... diving deep into the deepest darkest spaces of my laptops configuration. My laptop suddenly got very angry with me and decided that the C drive was too full, or that suddenly docker desktop and the dotnet framework would disappear from my machine! I desperately wanted to just code and run the [distilleries API](../2023-08-07-net-core-api-distilleries/2023-08-07-net-core-api-distilleries.md) in a simple developer environment. Well, everyone, there is a way, and that way is [gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io).
