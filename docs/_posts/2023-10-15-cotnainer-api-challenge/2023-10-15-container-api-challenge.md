After the disappoint of the rugby and the need to distract myself from the lingering hangover I decided to throw down myself a challenge... To deploy a dotnet API hosted on a container app in Azure as quickly as possible with all my favourite tools like docker, terraform, gitpod and github actions. That's it. Nice and simple. Lets dooo eeet!

## Prerequisites

- [Github Account](https://www.github.com) - If you haven't already get yourself a github account. 
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) - To save worrying about configuring your developer machine, I recommend using [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) or [github codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) (I still need to explore this!).
- [Docker Account](https://hub.docker.com/signup) which you can get for free.
- [Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) which you can get for free.

## Create the Platform

The platform is simply going to be an azure azure container environment. I have chosen this because it seems a really cost effective and easy way of hosting containers. I will use [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) as the image registry as I already have this setup.
