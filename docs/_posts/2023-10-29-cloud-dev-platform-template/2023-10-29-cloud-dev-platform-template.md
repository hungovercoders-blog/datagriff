After the disappoint of the rugby and the need to distract myself from the lingering hangover I decided to throw down myself a challenge... To deploy a dotnet API hosted on a container app in Azure as quickly as possible with all my favourite tools like docker, terraform, gitpod and github actions. That's it. Nice and simple. Lets dooo eeet!

## Prerequisites

- [Github Account](https://www.github.com) - If you haven't already get yourself a github account.
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) - To save worrying about configuring your developer machine, I recommend using [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) or [github codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
- [Azure Account](https://www.portal.azure.com) - A could environment to deploy your assets.
