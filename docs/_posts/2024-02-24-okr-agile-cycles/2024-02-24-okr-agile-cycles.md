It's been nearly 2 years since I posted one of my [first blogs which was around OKRs (objectives and key results)](https://blog.hungovercoders.com/datagriff/2022/09/17/team-okr-hdd.html){:target="_blank"}. Since then I have been preaching their usage and loving the concept... but I have completely missed integrating their ideas into the day to day agile working practices, rendering them ineffective. Spurred on by co-workers, my will to ensure that prioritisation of value is easy during iteration ceremonies, and the awesome book [Succeeding with OKRs in Agile](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Succeeding-OKRs-Agile-deliver-objectives-ebook/dp/B0CGXLGL74){:target="_blank"}, below are my thoughts on how to integrate OKR cycles into the agile framework.
